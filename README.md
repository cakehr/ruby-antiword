Build Antiword on Heroku
========================

Inspiration for this was borrowed (read: stolen) from [Josh's Ruby-xpdf](https://github.com/josh/ruby-xpdf). This gem allows you to install and use antiword on heroku by simply adding it to your gem file.

Install
=======

   gem 'antiword', :git => 'git://github.com/yagudaev/ruby-antiword.git'

And that it... really :).
